# Work-Day Planner

A simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the work day (9am to 5pm).  Hour Rows
are color-coded depending on the current time to help the user easily keep track of the current hour, past hour(s), and 
upcoming hour(s).

Here is a link to the deployed app: https://roccolosito.github.io/dayPlanner/
